## 🏆 Hackathon Context

**Event**: LMA EDGE Hackathon

**Focus Areas**: AI, LegalTech, DLT (Distributed Ledger Technology)

**Mission Alignment**: Advances LMA's mission across liquidity, efficiency, transparency, and sustainability

---

## 🧪 Development

### Running Tests

```bash
# Unit/Component tests
npm run test

# E2E tests
npm run test:e2e
```

### Code Quality

- TypeScript strict mode
- ESLint + Prettier
- Zod schema validation for all API boundaries
- Component tests for critical flows
- E2E test for happy path demo

---

## 📝 Key Principles

1. **Feature-first modularity** - Each module owns its UI, hooks, services, types
2. **No data fetching in components** - Only via hooks/services
3. **Zod-validated contracts** - At API boundary (even for mocks)
4. **Cross-cutting concerns centralized** - Theme, i18n, role, shell
5. **Navigation is config-driven** - Single source of truth
6. **Deterministic demo mode** - Fixtures → stable flows → reliable video

---

## 🔐 Architecture Highlights

### Multi-Tenancy
- Tenant ID derived from JWT claims (no header spoofing)
- Prisma Client Extensions for automatic tenant filtering
- AsyncLocalStorage for request-scoped context
- All queries tenant-safe by default

### Authentication & Authorization
- OIDC/OAuth 2.0 flow via Keycloak
- JWT validation on every API request
- 12 enterprise roles: TENANT_ADMIN, COMPLIANCE_AUDITOR, TRADING_ANALYST, etc.
- Controller-level `@Roles()` decorators + global `RolesGuard`
- UI role simulation for demo purposes (UI-only, backend still enforces)

### Audit & Observability
- Every mutation logged to `AuditEvent` table
- Enriched with: actor, roles, tenant, correlation ID, IP, user agent
- Centralized `AuditService` ensures consistency
- Immutable by design (no updates/deletes)
- Audit viewer UI with filters and export

### Desktop Security (Tauri v2)
- **Stronghold Plugin** - Encrypted vault for refresh tokens
- **Argon2-based Key Derivation** - Brute-force resistant
- **System Browser Auth** - RFC 8252 compliant (no embedded webview)
- **Deep Link Callback** - `lexa-ledger://auth/callback`
- **OS-level Security** - Credentials managed by system keychain

### Data Pipeline
```
User Action
    ↓
NestJS Controller (JWT validated, roles checked)
    ↓
Service Layer (business logic)
    ↓
Prisma (tenant-filtered queries via extension)
    ↓
PostgreSQL (row-level tenant isolation)
    ↓
Audit Trail (immutable event log)
    ↓
Redis + BullMQ (async processing)
    ↓
Worker (SERVICE actor, tenant context preserved)
```

- Switch between role sets instantly
- Shows UI changes without backend login
- Clear "UI Role Simulation" badge
- Backend always enforces real token

### Identity Panel
- Shows user, tenant, roles from JWT
- Server-validated identity (proof panel)
- Correlation ID for request tracing
- One-click copy for debugging

### Audit Trail Demo
1. Perform action (create loan, upload doc, etc.)
2. Copy correlation ID from Identity Panel
3. Open Audit Viewer (`/audit`)
4. Search by correlation ID
5. See complete request trace with actor context
